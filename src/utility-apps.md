As an interdisciplinary generalist whose career spans a broad range of client services & consulting engagements, Mark is uniquely poised to quickly understand requirements and context so he can get to work turning ideas and solutions into working code. Utility app projects typically include: jobs that run behind the scenes to synch or transform data, apps or plugins that extend an existing platform, apps to support the tasks of a small team, working prototypes to validate or sell a concept, or new frameworks around existing&nbsp;data.
